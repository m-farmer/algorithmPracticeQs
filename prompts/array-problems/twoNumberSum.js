/*
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and a target value. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target, the function should return an array of those numbers in any order. Otherwise return an empty array.

The target sum can only be found by adding two distinct integers together, not adding an integer to itself.
