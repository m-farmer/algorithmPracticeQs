/*

Write a function, nextGreater, accepts an array and returns an array containing the next greater element (NGE) for every element.

The NGE for an element x is the first element that is larger than x on the right side of the array.
Elements for which no greater element exists will have an NGE of -1.
Examples
const array = [4, 5, 2, 25];
console.log(nextGreater(array)); // expect [5, 25, 25, -1]

const array2 = [13, 7, 6, 12];
console.log(nextGreater(array2)); // expect [-1, 12, 12, -1]
