/*

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers.

Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

The sequence is often defined as the 0th number (F0) is 0, (F1) is 1, (F2) is 1.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34  55

0  1  2  3  4  5  6   7   8   9  10

constraints 0 <= n


Example:

fib(5) --> 5
fib(6) ---> 8
fib(10) --> 55

Keep in mind possible alternatives to a brute force recursion solution.
